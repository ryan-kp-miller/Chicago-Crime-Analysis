# Chicago Crime Analysis

Here I performed an analysis of the crime within Chicago based on this publicly provided [dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2) from the city of Chicago. My two main goals with this project were to create a machine learning model to predict whether a new crime will get an arrest and to build a dashboard using Power BI to allow for interactive exploration of the data. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to achieve a significant increase over the baseline accuracy (covered in the [ML Results](#ml-results) section). But I was able to build the interactive dashboard that you can download here.


## Overview

This project is broken up into four main files:
  - [Data_Preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/ryan-kp-miller/Chicago-Crime-Analysis/blob/master/Data_Preprocessing.ipynb)
  - [Data_Exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/ryan-kp-miller/Chicago-Crime-Analysis/blob/master/Data_Exploration.ipynb)
  - [Predicting_Arrests.ipynb](https://github.com/ryan-kp-miller/Chicago-Crime-Analysis/blob/master/Predicting_Arrests.ipynb)
  - [Chicago_Crime_Dashboard.pbix](https://github.com/ryan-kp-miller/Chicago-Crime-Analysis/blob/master/Chicago_Crime_Dashboard.pbix)

The first two Jupyter Notebooks go into detail on how and why I chose to preprocess the data and what I found when exploring the data respectively. I will briefly summarize this in the [Data Preprocessing](#data-preprocessing) and [Data Exploration](#data-exploration) sections below.

The third notebook, Predicting_Arrests.ipynb, shows some of the attempts I made at predicting whether an arrest will occur for a new crime and talks about the results of my attempts. In [ML Results](#ml-results), I will reiterate what was covered in the notebook, why I did what I did, and my future goals for this model.

Finally, I will go over how to set everything up, so you can explore the data yourself using the Power BI dashboard I built in the [Dashboard Setup](#dashboard-setup) section.
